Pillars of OOP

1. Abstraction - taking away the detail, making things available, high methods available for an end user

2. Encapsulation - hiding away the things that are dangerous

3. Inheritance - parent classes and subclasses, creating another class to inherit the methods

4. Polymorphism - meaning "many-shapes-ism" subclasses can look different from other subclasses as well as the parent
