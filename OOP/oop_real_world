Smart Phone

1. Abstraction - don't need to know how the OS works or how a text is sent or the camera functions
    you just press apps, compile and press send and take pictures

2. Encapsulation - what previously were different things are packaged into one:
    music player, camera, calling, texting, video player, games console, web searcher

3. Inheritance - new smart phones come out each year, with subtle to major differences but there are
    always inherited features from the OS, to camera and text functionality

4. Polymorphism - there are different smart phones ranging in functionality and OS. They have
    similarities but also differences from each other as well as the overall class of 'smart phone'


Medicine

1. Abstraction - don't need to understand or know how the medicine works, you just take it

2. Encapsulation - could literally be the tablet, injection or otherwise that physically holds the
    medicine in, it could even hold different different types of medicine

3. Inheritance - the refining and updating of drugs, possible even doses, could have inherited certain
    features from previous medicine

4. Polymorphism - lots of different forms of medicine to treat different things. there may be
    similarities and differences between them and the overall class of 'medicine'
