Test Driven Development

1. Write the test (it will fail)
2. Write the code needed to make the test pass
3. Refactor your code
REPEAT

Benefits:
- You have a suite of tests
- You know your code better
- You code better
    - Because you're thinking about your inputs and outputs
    - It's lean - you're only delivering what is needed
    - You deliver code that is testable
    - You break down the problem at hand
